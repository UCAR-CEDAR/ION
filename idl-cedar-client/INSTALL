INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

  To install the IDL source files, follow these steps:

  0. Please skim BUILD REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before
     reporting problems. Make sure you read over the CONFIGURATION AND
     TESTING section!
     Thanks.

  1. Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have
     to type `sh configure'.

  3. Type `make install' to install the idl source files. The package installs
     in /usr/local/share/idl by default.  If you would like to change this
     use the --prefix=<install_dir> option to configure. This will place the
     idl source files in /install_dir/share/idl. If you need the idl source
     to go to a different location, please use the --with-pro=<directory>
     option to configure. This will place the idl source in the specified
     directory.

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make install'. If you try to run autoconf by hand and wind
  up with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'
  and then './configure; make install'.

AFTER INSTALLING

  o Set IDL_PATH environment variable to include the location where the idl
  source files were installed. For example, if installed in the default
  location, be sure that IDL_PATH includes /usr/local/share/idl.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS

  o To build from a fresh SVN checkout, you'll need automake 1.9.2, autoconf
    2.59 (2.57 will probably work and that's what's listed in the configure.ac
    file).5.6. Earlier versions may work, but may cause problems,
    particularly with the 'distcheck' target for make. Given those
    requirements, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose' and then build as
    described above.

  o To use the idl source included in this package you will need
     the idl-libdap-client version 1.0.0, which in turn requires
     libdap-3.8.0.

NOTES

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - To enable debugging add a parameter to the end of the cedar_data call,
      like so:

stat=cedar_data( 5340,'7001' ,$
           ' 800|21|34|130|140|810|1410|1420|2506' ,$
           ' DAYNO|UTH|AZM|ELM|VNLU|TN|VNE|VNN|RBRL' ,$
           ' mfp920504a' ,$
           ' 1992','05','04','1992','05','13', 'Pwest' ,data, DEBUG=1 )

CONFIGURATION AND TESTING

  o CONFIGURATION

    - There is no special configuration for the idl source files

  o TESTING

    - Once you have installed the software you can run the idl command
      included in this document above in an idl interpreter. It should
      return you some data in the 'data' variable.
